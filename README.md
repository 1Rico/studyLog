# StudyLog
A Study Log Web Application I built to log my progress during self created streaks.

## Usage
The main Concept of this is to create **Streaks**. Streaks are days related to a specific tag. The App allows one Log *Once* per day.

## TODOs
* Notification on end of Streak
* Tags History
* Reports

### Development
* *Laravel* >= 5.4
* *PHP* >= 5.6 (7 recommended)
* *Homestead, Valet* - Optional
* *Built-in Server*
